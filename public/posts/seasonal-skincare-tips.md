## Why Your Skin Needs Change with the Seasons

Just as you switch your wardrobe with the changing seasons, your skin requires different care throughout the year. Environmental factors like humidity, temperature, and UV intensity all impact your skin's behavior and needs. Understanding these changes and adapting accordingly can make the difference between good skin and great skin.

### How Weather Affects Your Skin

**Temperature Changes**
- Cold weather reduces blood circulation, leading to dullness
- Heat increases oil production and can cause breakouts
- Rapid temperature changes can trigger sensitivity

**Humidity Levels**
- Low humidity (winter) leads to increased water loss
- High humidity (summer) can clog pores and increase oiliness
- Indoor heating and cooling affect skin moisture levels

**UV Exposure**
- Varies significantly by season and location
- Winter sun can be deceptively damaging, especially with snow reflection
- Summer requires maximum protection

**Air Quality**
- Pollution levels can vary seasonally
- Indoor air quality changes with heating/cooling systems
- Allergens peak at different times of year
